# Bank Register UI Specification

## Overview

The Bank Register screen is the primary accounting interface
for viewing and managing transactions per account.

It behaves like a continuous ledger view similar to QuickBooks.

---

# Core Purpose

The Bank Register allows users to:

- view account transaction history
- add new financial entries
- inspect running balance
- perform actions (post, reverse, void)
- maintain audit visibility

---

# Layout Structure

The screen is divided into 4 main sections:

## Visual Style (QuickBooks-like)

- white, minimal layout with consistent `text-sm` baseline
- primary text colors use gray scale (`gray-800` / `gray-900`)
- app-wide font stack should prefer `Avenir Next forINTUIT`, then `Avenir Next`, `Avenir`, `Helvetica`, `Arial`, `sans-serif`
- top header includes:
  - back link (`Back to Chart of Accounts`) with left arrow, blue hoverable text
  - `Bank Register` title with semibold emphasis
  - account selector in compact bordered control with right chevron
  - right-side `Reconcile` green action button
  - ending balance label (`uppercase`, `tracking-wide`) with prominent amount
- pagination/navigation strip includes `Go to` input, first/prev/next/last actions, and range summary
- table pagination appears above and below the register table, right-aligned, with format:
  - `Go to:<page> of <pages> < First Previous <start>-<end> of <total> Next Last >`
- pagination blocks are rendered outside the table component (in page layout), one above and one below
- the page number after `Go to:` and navigation labels are rendered as links (placeholder behavior for now)
- when there are no pages, pagination links use disabled color token `--color-text-disabled`
- when enabled and hovered, pagination links use highlight token `--color-text-highlight`
- action toolbar uses blue text split control (`Add <Type>`) with chevron dropdown
- table container includes filter bar above header:
  - left filter indicator (`All`)
  - right-side utility actions (print/export/settings)
- table uses:
  - gray header background and uppercase tiny labels
  - fixed-width numeric columns and right-aligned amounts
  - hoverable ledger rows with subtle border separators
- draft/edit input rows use blue-tinted background and focus-ring input styles
- disabled fields use gray background, gray text, and non-interactive cursor
- table area can support horizontal scrolling on small screens, but dropdown menus must never be clipped
- selector fields follow a shared text-field style:
  - input text size comes from CSS variable `--font-size-input-text` (`16px`)
  - `h-9` (36px), inherited font, `text-sm`, `leading-[1.2]`
  - bordered white surface with small radius and transition on background/border/shadow
  - custom chevron icon uses the shared 24x24 down-chevron SVG
  - supports width behavior: parent `min-w-fit w-fit` keeps compact `208px`; `w-full` expands to container width
- `Register bank`, `Payee`, and `Account` must use one shared reusable `SelectField` component
- `SelectField` supports optional `+ Add new` action controlled by prop and callback
- `SelectField` dropdown must support wider readable width for long option texts and be left-aligned slightly outside input edge
- selected option in `SelectField` uses `--font-size-component-medium` and passive subtle background states:
  - `--color-action-passive-subtle-hover`
  - `--color-action-passive-subtle-focus`
  - `--color-action-passive-subtle-active`
- selected option label text (first span) is bold
- global CSS override file is available at `src/styles/tailwind-overrides.css` and loaded after Tailwind globals for higher-priority rules

## 1. General Balance Overview (Top Summary)

- Shows a single "Balance General" amount for the currently selected account register
- Initial value must be 0.00 at startup

## 3. Action Toolbar

The toolbar uses a split action control:

- Primary button: `Add <Selected Transaction Type>`
- Secondary button: chevron down to open transaction type menu

Behavior:

- Clicking the primary button creates a transaction using the last selected type
- Clicking chevron opens the available transaction types for the selected account
- Selecting a type in the menu:
  - updates the primary button label
  - opens a new inline draft row at the top of the register table

Transaction type availability is account-driven:

- UI calls a resolver with selected account
- resolver returns supported transaction types for that account
- each type provides both ID and label for rendering/behavior

For `Cash on hand (Bank)`, available types must be:

- Check
- Deposit
- Sales Receipt
- Receive Payment
- Bill Payment
- Refund
- Expense
- Transfer
- Journal Entry

For `Credit Card Payable (Credit Card)`, available types must be:

- CC Expense
- Expense
- CC Credit
- Bill Payment
- Transfer
- Journal Entry

For `Charitable donations (Equity)`, available types must be:

- Transfer
- Journal Entry

# State Behavior

UI state is driven by:

---

# Loading States

---

# Design Principles

- Ledger-first UI (not CRUD UI)
